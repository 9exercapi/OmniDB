The Promise tells the story of Qingcheng, a girl who makes a deal with the goddess Manshen to become the most beautiful woman in the land and enjoy a luxurious life. However, she has to pay a price: she will never find true love with any man. She becomes the concubine of the King, who is besieged by the traitorous Duke Wuhuan. Meanwhile, General Guangming defeats an army of barbarians and rushes back to save the King. He is wounded by Wuhuan's henchman Snow Wolf, but is saved by his slave Kunlun. He orders Kunlun to wear his crimson armor and rescue the King. Kunlun arrives at the palace and mistakes Qingcheng for the King because she is unarmed. He kills the King and flees with Qingcheng. They are cornered by Wuhuan and his men at a cliff. Wuhuan promises to spare Qingcheng if Kunlun jumps off the cliff. Kunlun does so but survives. He returns to save Guangming from his rebellious subordinates. Qingcheng falls in love with Guangming, thinking he is the one who jumped off the cliff. Kunlun is captured by Wuhuan, who learns he is the real killer of the King.
