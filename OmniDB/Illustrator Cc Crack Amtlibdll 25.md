Photoshop and Illustrator CC are two other Adobe applications that have the Creative Cloud Libraries feature integrated into them. This means that you can access and use any Library that you create or save from InDesign in these applications as well. You can also do the reverse: any Library that you create or save in Photoshop and Illustrator can be accessed and used in InDesign. This way, you can easily share and reuse your assets across different Adobe applications.

Creative Cloud Libraries are not only useful for sharing assets between applications, but also for collaborating with other people. You can invite other Creative Cloud users to view or edit your Libraries, and they can do the same for you. You can also sync your Libraries across different devices, so you can access them from anywhere.
  
Another benefit of Creative Cloud Libraries is that they are connected to Adobe Stock, a collection of millions of high-quality images, graphics, videos, and more. You can browse and preview Adobe Stock assets directly from your Libraries panel, and license them with a single click. You can also save your own creations to Adobe Stock and earn royalties when others use them.
  
Creative Cloud Libraries are a powerful and convenient way to manage your creative assets and workflows. Whether you are working on a print, web, or mobile project, you can use Libraries to streamline your process and enhance your productivity.
